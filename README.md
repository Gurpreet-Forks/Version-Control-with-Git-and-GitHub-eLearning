# Version Control with Git and GitHub [eLearning]
Version control is a software component that provides change management and supports the tracking of changes on a file. Git is a version control tool to track, retrieve and share changes on a repository while GitHub is a popular web-based hosting service where a repository resides.
This course introduces version control, its relevance, and usage. In the first part, you’ll learn how to set up and configure Git on your computer. Then, you’ll create a repository and use it for exercises throughout the course. Through multiple demos, you’ll learn concepts that show various stages of a file - from when it is untracked to when it is set for tracking under version control. In the second part, you’ll learn about forking as part of a collaborative workflow. You’ll learn addressing modularity and duplication through submodules, tracing and rectifying faulty changes, and maintaining repositories. The second part ends with you learning how to deploy applications using GitHub.
